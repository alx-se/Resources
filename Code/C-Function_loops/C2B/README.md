# ALX Session: C - Functions and Nested Loops

Welcome to the ALX session on C programming focusing on functions and nested loops! In this session, we will work through several tasks that will help reinforce your understanding of these fundamental concepts in C programming.

## Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:
- Understand and implement functions in C.
- Utilize nested loops effectively.
- Differentiate between function declarations and definitions.
- Use header files and prototypes correctly.
- Apply coding standards and best practices.

## Tasks

We will complete the following tasks during this session:

### Task 1: Print Uppercase Alphabet

**Objective:**
Write a function that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** 
```c
void print_uppercase_alphabet(void);
```

### Task 2: Print Numbers 0 to 9 Ten Times

**Objective:**
Write a function that prints numbers from 0 to 9, ten times, followed by a new line each time.

**Prototype:** 
```c
void print_numbers_x10(void);
```

### Task 3: Check for Uppercase Character

**Objective:**
Write a function that checks for an uppercase character.

**Prototype:** 
```c
int _isupper(int c);
```

### Task 4: Print Multiplication Table up to n

**Objective:**
Write a function that prints the multiplication table up to `n`.

**Prototype:** 
```c
void print_multiplication_table(int n);
```
