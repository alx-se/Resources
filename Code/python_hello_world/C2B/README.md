## Live Workshop on Python Programming Concepts!
This is the code we used for live learning Cohort 2 Blended Live workshop going through the following concepts

### Key Topics

- **Python Basics:** We’ll start with Python basics, including the importance of indentation, assigning values to variables, and using comments and string formatters. You’ll also learn how to print text and variables effectively.

- **Control Flow:** For control flow, we’ll dive into if statements, loops (while and for), and how to use break, continue, and the range function.

- **Functions:** We’ll cover functions, focusing on defining and using them, the return statement, and variable scope.

- **Error Handling and Debugging:** You’ll gain insights into error handling by understanding IndentationError and how to read tracebacks.

- **Style and Best Practices:** We’ll review the Pycodestyle guide for Python code and discuss best practices for checking your code.

- **Command line arguments**: Accepting input through the command line


### Tasks we worked on
- Here's a summary of what we worked on:

1. **We created a Python script that demonstrated string formatting and basic conditionals. The script:**
  1. Showed different ways to format strings using `print()` statements.
  2. Included examples of f-strings and `.format()` method for string interpolation.
  3. Handled an error in formatting and corrected it.
  4. Utilized `sys.argv` to handle command-line arguments and implemented conditionals to check if a number is greater than, equal to, or less than 8.

2. **Odd Numbers with While Loop:**
   - We used a `while` loop to print odd numbers from 1 up to but not including 16, skipping a specific number (7 in this case) and handling formatting to ensure the output ends correctly.

3. **Multiplication Function:**
   - We defined a function `mult_numbers()` to multiply two numbers and return the result. The function was tested with example inputs and results printed.

4. **FizzBuzz Problem:**
   - We implemented a solution to the FizzBuzz problem, iterating through numbers from 1 to 50. For each number:
     - Print "fizzbuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5.
     - Print "fizz" if divisible by 3.
     - Print "buzz" if divisible by 5.
     - Print the number itself if none of the above conditions are met.
